        "Salmon works really well with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 16 dollars per bottle.",

            "Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.",

    summary:
      "The recipe Smashed white bean and kale quesadillas with creamy bbq dip could satisfy your Mexican craving in about 20 minutes. This recipe serves 2 and costs $2.83 per serving. One serving contains 1076 calories, 56g of protein, and 52g of fat. Several people made this recipe, and 6521 would say it hit the spot. A mixture of bbq sauce, tuscan kale, sharp cheddar cheese, and a handful of other ingredients are all it takes to make this recipe so delicious. To use up the extra virgin olive oil you could follow this main course with the Peach Crisp: Healthy Crisp for Breakfast as a dessert. It works well as an affordable main course for The Super Bowl. It is a good option if you're following a vegetarian diet. All things considered, we decided this recipe deserves a spoonacular score of 100%. This score is amazing.

The best wine for Asian food depends on the cuisine and dish - of course - but these acidic whites pair with a number of traditional meals, spicy or not.

            "The Lang & Reed Chenin Blanc – Napa Valley has peach and tropical fruit that are immediately on the nose, with the necessary hint of honeycomb (the traditional varietal character), and a lesser expression of apple and citrus. On the palate, the aromas are mirrored and given an even stronger presence with yellow apple exotic citrus notes, which give it anaccurate tartness. The texture is tender, and the flavors broaden with a touch of saline minerality, which leads into bright crisp acidity, adding to the wine’s refreshing character. It will blossom and gain in complexity with additional bottle time.",

    summary:
      "Lemon Thyme Tuna Burgers is a gluten free, dairy free, and pescatarian main course. One serving contains 160 calories, 22g of protein, and 2g of fat. This recipe serves 2 and costs 83 cents per serving. Several people made this recipe, and 3042 would say it hit the spot. A mixture of lemon juice, tuna, egg white, and a handful of other ingredients are all it takes to make this recipe so flavorful. To use up the old fashioned oats you could follow this main course with the Oatmeal Berry Breakfast Cake [Dairy, Gluten & Sugar Free] as a dessert. This recipe is typical of American cuisine. All things considered, we decided this recipe deserves a spoonacular score of 88%. This score is great. Try Lemon & thyme turkey burgers, Lemon and Thyme Grilled Tuna, and Olive Oil Poached Tunan Infused with Thyme, Lemon, and Shallots for similar recipes.",

        "Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine are my top picks for Tuna. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Bonterran Elysian Organically Grown Merlot with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.",

A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your ahi tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine.

The palate is rich and powerful with good balance.Savor as an aperitif or with simple dishes that showcase the wine.\nThe Riesling vines are spread all over the 13.6 acres of the Clos-Saint-Urbain in the Rangen Grand Cru vineyard. Being located at the opening of a cold and higher altitude valley, the Rangen enjoys a late ripening climate, but eventually catches up in October, when the steep slope (90%) and dark warm volcanic rocks allow the grapes to reach a high ripeness level. Zind-Humbrecht's dedication to terroir expression guides all winemaking practices, which include extended pressing cycles, abbreviated clarification cycles (to retain natural yeasts and proteins in the must), natural malolactic fermentation and extended aging on the lees. The wine is aged 18 months in 40-year-old French barrels.",

The dressing will thicken as it stands (especially when chilled) so you can add more water to thin out as necessary. Need a nut-free dressing? Try this Lemon Tahini dressing on for size.The first time I made this dish I was so hungry (and the dish was so tasty!) I ate almost the entire dish straight from the mixing bowl with a fork. My camera wasnt quick enough for me this time! Thats when I came up with the name Buddha Bowl because I was rocking a Buhhda-like belly the rest of the day.

            "This beautiful wine is wonderfully consistent vintage after vintage. We receive superior Chenin Blanc fruit from the Wilson Ranch in Clarksburg, allowing us to produce an expressive, nuanced and delicious wine. At first swirl, aromatics of white pear, pineapple and banana spring forward from the glass. On the palate, the wine is refreshing with flavors of ripe tangerine and peaches. The mouthfeel is lively, but rich and has a subtle creaminess. 100% stainless steel fermentation guarantees the fresh fruit character fans of this wine have come to appreciate over the years. This is the quintessential summer sipper and the perfect wine to pair with fresh oysters!",

The elegant mousse will refresh your palate for the next bite and contrasting the bubbles with something soft or creamy can elevate  your next meal.

        "No one wine will suit every pasta dish. Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.",

Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The Flowers Sonoma Coast Chardonnay ( half-bottle) with a 4.2 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.",

            "The ripening season was classic Russian River, with warm days and cool nights—and with no major heat spells, the fruit ripening was perfect to give lush tannins, bright berry fruit and bright acidity. The wine shows rich, dense black cherry and blackberry fruit and nuances of strawberry, raspberry, and nutmeg in the nose. In the mouth, the first impression is fresh berry fruit, then the soft, broad tannins carry notes of marionberries, nutmeg and sandalwood through a lingering finish. Thanks partially to the moderate alcohol and bright acidity, the finish lingers with fresh cherry fruit and creamy berry compote.\nThis wine has a broad range of food pairings, whether alone with some well chosen cheeses, richer fish preparations or a good old steak on the barbeque.",

        "Salmon can be paired with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. The De Wetshof Lesca Chardonnay with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 16 dollars per bottle.",

        "Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir are my top picks for Cod. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Argento Pinot Grigio. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle.",

        "Salmon works really well with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. One wine you could try is NV Mindbender Chardonnay. It has 4.4 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 12 dollars.",

        "Mexican works really well with Pinot Noir, Riesling, and Sparkling rosé. Acidic white wines like riesling or low-tannin reds like pinot noir can work well with Mexican dishes. Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. The Gary Farrell Russian River Pinot Noir with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 42 dollars per bottle.",

Intense aromas of dark fruits, particularly cherries and plums, are matched with warm spices and a leathery earthiness. The palate shows great depth, weight and acidity with a seductive texture which leads to a balanced finish that confirms the nose. The 2007 Russian River Selection Pinot Noir shows wonderful balanced acidity and generous fruit that will pair beautifully with grilled rosemary pork tenderloin.",

        "Sangiovese, Barbera Wine, and Shiraz are great choices for Pizza. The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. You could try Caposaldo Chianti. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 13 dollars per bottle.",

        "Pizza can be paired with Sangiovese, Barbera Wine, and Shiraz. The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Rodano Vigna Viacosta Chianti Classico with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 30 dollars per bottle.",
