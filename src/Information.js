        "Salmon works really well with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Sauvignon Blanc. To decide on white or red, you should consider your seasoning and sauces. Chardonnay is a great friend to buttery, creamy dishes, while sauvignon blanc can complement herb or citrus-centric dishes. A light-bodied, low-tannin red such as the pinot noir goes great with broiled or grilled salmon. You could try Downton Abbey Countess of Grantham Chardonnay. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 16 dollars per bottle.",

            "Our Downton Abbey Chardonnay displays lovely aromas of tropical fruits and subtle oak on the nose, which give way to flavors of citrus and fresh-cut pineapple on a soft, silky palate. The wine's bright characters and luscious mouthfeel continue through a clean, medium finish. The beautifully balanced and food-friendly bottling is the perfect wine choice for you most regal gatherings or spontaneous get-togethers.",

    summary:
      "The recipe Smashed white bean and kale quesadillas with creamy bbq dip could satisfy your Mexican craving in about 20 minutes. This recipe serves 2 and costs $2.83 per serving. One serving contains 1076 calories, 56g of protein, and 52g of fat. Several people made this recipe, and 6521 would say it hit the spot. A mixture of bbq sauce, tuscan kale, sharp cheddar cheese, and a handful of other ingredients are all it takes to make this recipe so delicious. To use up the extra virgin olive oil you could follow this main course with the Peach Crisp: Healthy Crisp for Breakfast as a dessert. It works well as an affordable main course for The Super Bowl. It is a good option if you're following a vegetarian diet. All things considered, we decided this recipe deserves a spoonacular score of 100%. This score is amazing.

On the palate, the aromas are mirrored and given an even stronger presence with yellow apple exotic citrus notes, which give it anaccurate tartness. The texture is tender, and the flavors broaden with a touch of saline minerality, which leads into bright crisp acidity, adding to the wine’s refreshing character.

    summary:
      "Lemon Thyme Tuna Burgers is a gluten free, dairy free, and pescatarian main course. One serving contains 160 calories, 22g of protein, and 2g of fat. This recipe serves 2 and costs 83 cents per serving. Several people made this recipe, and 3042 would say it hit the spot. A mixture of lemon juice, tuna, egg white, and a handful of other ingredients are all it takes to make this recipe so flavorful. To use up the old fashioned oats you could follow this main course with the Oatmeal Berry Breakfast Cake [Dairy, Gluten & Sugar Free] as a dessert. This recipe is typical of American cuisine. All things considered, we decided this recipe deserves a spoonacular score of 88%. This score is great. Try Lemon & thyme turkey burgers, Lemon and Thyme Grilled Tuna, and Olive Oil Poached Tunan Infused with Thyme, Lemon, and Shallots for similar recipes.",

        "Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine are my top picks for Tuna. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Bonterran Elysian Organically Grown Merlot with a 4.1 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.",

            "The nose is unmistakable Rangen, showing intense flinty, aromatic herbal aromas. The palate is rich and powerful with good balance.Savor as an aperitif or with simple dishes that showcase the wine.\nThe Riesling vines are spread all over the 13.6 acres of the Clos-Saint-Urbain in the Rangen Grand Cru vineyard. Being located at the opening of a cold and higher altitude valley, the Rangen enjoys a late ripening climate, but eventually catches up in October, when the steep slope (90%) and dark warm volcanic rocks allow the grapes to reach a high ripeness level. Zind-Humbrecht's dedication to terroir expression guides all winemaking practices, which include extended pressing cycles, abbreviated clarification cycles (to retain natural yeasts and proteins in the must), natural malolactic fermentation and extended aging on the lees. The wine is aged 18 months in 40-year-old French barrels.",
