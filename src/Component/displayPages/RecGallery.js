          Though it's not an authentic Italian dish, Chicken Vesuvio tastes like
          it could be. In actuality, it's a specialty of the Italian-American
          restaurants in my home town of Chicago, invented sometime in the 1930s
          and still going strong as a favorite around town. It's a rich, stewed
          dish with key elements of creamy potatoes, white wine, and plenty of
          garlic—as well as the final sprinkle of peas to give it color and
          freshness. - Blake Royer from Serious Eats Though it's not an
